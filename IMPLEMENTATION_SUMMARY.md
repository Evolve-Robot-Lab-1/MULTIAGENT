# LibreOffice Native Viewer Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Feature Flag System (main_copy.py)
```python
FEATURES = {
    'native_viewer': True,   # Enable/disable native viewer
    'debug_mode': True      # Enable logging
}
```

#### New Route for Native Viewer (main_copy.py)
- Route: `/view_document_native/<filename>`
- Converts documents to PDF using LibreOffice
- Falls back to HTML viewer on error
- Preserves all existing functionality

#### LibreOffice Native Viewer Service (app/services/libreoffice_native_viewer.py)
- Handles document conversion to PDF
- Checks LibreOffice availability
- Manages temporary files
- Supports multiple document formats

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Viewer Mode Toggle (indexf.html)
- Added toggle button in document toolbar
- Shows current mode (HTML/Native)
- Persists user preference in localStorage

#### Viewer Mode Manager (viewer-mode.js)
- Manages switching between HTML and Native modes
- Handles document loading based on mode
- Provides error handling and fallbacks
- Integrates with existing file handlers

#### CSS Styling (stylenew.css)
- Added styles for viewer toggle button
- Styled native viewer iframe
- Responsive design maintained

### 3. Integration Points

#### File Click Handler
- Modified to use ViewerModeManager when available
- Falls back to original implementation if not available
- Maintains compatibility with all file types

#### Edit Mode
- Checks current viewer mode
- Prompts to switch to HTML mode for editing
- Preserves all editing functionality

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Click on any document (DOC, DOCX, PDF)
2. Document opens in current viewer mode
3. Click toggle button to switch between HTML and Native view
4. Native view provides better formatting fidelity
5. HTML view required for editing and AI features

### For Developers:
1. Feature flag controls availability: `FEATURES['native_viewer']`
2. Test with: `python test_native_viewer.py`
3. Monitor logs for any issues
4. Easy rollback by setting feature flag to False

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
1. `DocAI/main_copy.py` - Added feature flags and native viewer route
2. `DocAI/static2.0/indexf.html` - Added toggle button and integration
3. `DocAI/static2.0/stylenew.css` - Added viewer toggle styles

### New Files:
1. `DocAI/app/services/libreoffice_native_viewer.py` - Native viewer service
2. `DocAI/static2.0/viewer-mode.js` - Frontend viewer manager
3. `DocAI/test_native_viewer.py` - Test script

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
cd DocAI
python test_native_viewer.py
```

Manual testing checklist:
- [ ] Start the application
- [ ] Upload a test document
- [ ] Click on the document
- [ ] Verify toggle button appears
- [ ] Test switching between modes
- [ ] Test edit mode in both views
- [ ] Test with different file formats
- [ ] Verify mode persists on reload

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Set `FEATURES['native_viewer'] = False` in main_copy.py
2. All functionality reverts to original HTML viewer
3. No data migration needed
4. No user impact

## Next Steps

1. Monitor usage and performance
2. Collect user feedback
3. Consider adding:
   - Print functionality in native viewer
   - Zoom controls
   - Page navigation for multi-page documents
   - Download options

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All existing features preserved
- ✅ Non-destructive implementation
