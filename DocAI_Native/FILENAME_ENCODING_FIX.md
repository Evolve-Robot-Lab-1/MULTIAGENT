# Filename Encoding Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The 404 NOT FOUND error when loading "ERL-Offer Letter.docx" was caused by a filename encoding mismatch:
- File on disk: `ERL-Offer%20Letter.docx` (URL-encoded)
- Application looking for: `ERL-Offer Letter.docx` (decoded)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed File Listing (`app/api/v1.py`)
- Added `from urllib.parse import unquote` import
- Decode filenames when listing: `decoded_filename = unquote(file_path.name)`
- Use decoded names for duplicate checking and search matching

### 2. Enhanced File Lookup (`backend_server.py`)
- Added `quote` to imports
- Try multiple filename variations:
  - Original decoded name
  - Name with `%20` for spaces
  - Fully URL-encoded name
- Added parent directory to search paths
- Check all combinations of directories and filename variations

## How It Works Now

1. **File Listing**: The `/api/v1/files` endpoint now returns decoded filenames, so "ERL-Offer%20Letter.docx" appears as "ERL-Offer Letter.docx" in the UI

2. **File Loading**: When clicking a file, the backend tries multiple variations to find the file:
   - First tries the exact name
   - Then tries with URL-encoded spaces
   - Finally tries fully encoded version

3. **Search Paths**: Extended to include:
   - Upload directories
   - Documents/DurgaAI
   - Documents (parent directory)
   - Legacy DocAI paths

## Testing
The application should now:
- Display files with spaces correctly in the left panel
- Load files with special characters when clicked
- Handle both encoded and decoded filenames seamlessly

No need to rename files - the application handles both formats automatically!
