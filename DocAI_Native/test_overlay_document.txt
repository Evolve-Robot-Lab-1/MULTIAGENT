LibreOffice Overlay Test Document
=================================

This is a test document to verify the overlay positioning system.

If you can see this in LibreOffice within the DocAI Native window,
then the overlay system is working correctly!

Test Features:
- Window positioning
- Decoration removal
- Position synchronization
- View mode switching

The LibreOffice window should:
1. Appear without title bar and borders
2. Stay positioned within the document viewer area
3. Move with the main window
4. Resize with the container

Congratulations! The overlay system is functional.
