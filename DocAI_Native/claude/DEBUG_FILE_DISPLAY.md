# Debug Instructions for File Display Issue

## Current Status
- File dialog opens ✓
- File can be selected ✓
- File is not showing in container ✗

## Debug Steps

### 1. Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for these messages when selecting a file:

```
v1.11 - handleOpenFile called
[handleWebOpenFile] Function called
[handleWebOpenFile] Input created: [object HTMLInputElement]
[handleWebOpenFile] About to click input
[handleWebOpenFile] Input clicked
[handleWebOpenFile] onchange triggered
[handleWebOpenFile] File selected: [File object]
[handleWebOpenFile] Reading file as text/data URL
[handleWebOpenFile] File read complete
[handleWebOpenFile] File extension: [ext]
[handleWebOpenFile] Checking for addFileToContainer...
[handleWebOpenFile] window.addFileToContainer: function/undefined
[handleWebOpenFile] Filebox element: [element]/null
```

### 2. Check for Errors
Look for any red error messages:
- "addFileToContainer not available"
- "Filebox element: null"
- "FileReader error"
- Any JavaScript errors

### 3. What to Report
Please share:
1. All console messages after clicking "Open File"
2. Any error messages
3. What type of file you're trying to open
4. Whether the success message appears in chat

## Possible Issues

### If "addFileToContainer not available":
The function isn't loaded yet. We may need to increase the timeout.

### If "Filebox element: null":
The file container div doesn't exist. We need to check the HTML structure.

### If no "File read complete":
The FileReader isn't working properly.

### If everything looks good but no file appears:
The addFileToContainer function might be failing silently.

## Quick Test
Try opening a simple .txt file first, as it's the most basic file type.
