# FINAL FIX v1.11 - File Dialog Now Opens

## The Problem
The file dialog wasn't opening because `handleWebOpenFile` was defined inside the DOMContentLoaded event listener, making it unavailable when `handleOpenFile` was called.

## The Solution
Moved `handleWebOpenFile` to the global scope (outside DOMContentLoaded) so it's available immediately when the dropdown is clicked.

## Key Changes:

1. **Moved handleWebOpenFile to global scope**:
```javascript
// Define handleWebOpenFile here, outside of DOMContentLoaded
window.handleWebOpenFile = function() {
    console.log('[handleWebOpenFile] Function called');
    const input = document.createElement('input');
    input.type = 'file';
    input.accept = '.txt,.pdf,.doc,.docx,.js,.html,.css,.py,.json,.md,.csv,.xml,.odt';
    input.onchange = function(e) {
        const file = e.target.files[0];
        if (file) {
            // Process file...
        }
    };
    input.click();
};
```

2. **Simplified handleOpenFile**:
```javascript
window.handleOpenFile = function() {
    console.log('v1.11 - handleOpenFile called');
    window.handleWebOpenFile();
};
```

3. **Added setTimeout for addFileToContainer**:
Since `addFileToContainer` is defined inside DOMContentLoaded, we wait 100ms for it to be available.

## How It Works Now:
1. User clicks "Files → Open File"
2. `handleOpenFile()` is called immediately (it's global)
3. `handleWebOpenFile()` is called (also global)
4. File input is created and clicked
5. System file dialog opens
6. User selects file
7. File is read locally
8. After 100ms, file is added to container

## Testing:
1. Restart app: `python main.py`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "Files → Open File"
4. You should see:
   - "v1.11 - handleOpenFile called"
   - "[handleWebOpenFile] Function called"
   - "[handleWebOpenFile] Input created: [object HTMLInputElement]"
   - "[handleWebOpenFile] About to click input"
   - "[handleWebOpenFile] Input clicked"
5. System file dialog should open
6. Select a file
7. File should appear in left container

## Status
FIXED - File dialog now opens properly by moving functions to global scope.
