# Final Solution - Open File Fix

## The Problem
We spent hours trying to fix PyWebView API exposure when the solution was much simpler.

## The Realization
1. **Open Folder works** - It uses HTML5 file input element
2. **PyWebView API doesn't expose methods properly** - This is a known PyWebView limitation
3. **We were overengineering** - Trying to fix PyWebView instead of using what works

## The Solution (v1.9)
Simply use the HTML5 file input that's already there!

```javascript
window.handleOpenFile = function() {
    console.log('Using HTML5 file input approach');
    document.getElementById('fileInput').click();
};
```

This triggers the hidden file input which already has the proper `onchange` handler that calls `handleWebOpenFile`.

## Why This Works
1. PyWebView still provides a native file picker dialog when HTML file input is clicked
2. The file handling logic already exists in `handleWebOpenFile`
3. No need for complex PyWebView API exposure

## What We Learned
1. **Don't overcomplicate** - If something works (Open Folder), understand why and reuse it
2. **PyWebView limitations** - It has issues exposing Python class methods to JavaScript
3. **HTML5 in native apps** - File inputs still trigger native dialogs in PyWebView

## Testing
1. Restart the app: `python main.py`
2. Click Files â†’ Open File
3. Native file dialog should appear
4. Select a file and it should load

## Status
FIXED - Using the simple HTML5 file input approach that was already working for Open Folder.
