# DocAI Development Session Log
**Date**: 2025-06-21
**Time**: 00:54 - 02:30 AM

## Session Summary

### 1. Initial State
- Virtual environment was corrupted/incomplete
- Frontend and backend needed to run separately on different ports
- Had issues with restarting servers for local testing

### 2. What We Accomplished

#### A. Checked Current Codebase Features
- ✅ Chat AI connected with streaming support (`/api/query_stream`)
- ✅ RAG support in chat (sends `use_rag: true`)
- ✅ Three-panel layout (left: files, center: doc viewer, right: chat)
- ✅ Document editing with `contentEditable`
- ✅ LibreOffice viewing via `/view_document/` endpoint
- ❌ File upload menu handlers not implemented

#### B. Created Working Backup
- **Location**: `/backups/DocAI_WORKING_2025-06-21_02-02-15_FULL_INTEGRATION`
- Captured fully working state with separate frontend/backend

#### C. Fixed Single Server Setup
- **Issue**: 404 error handler was intercepting static file requests and returning JSON
- **Solution**: Added catch-all route to serve static files properly
- Modified `main_copy.py` to serve both frontend and backend from single port (8090)

#### D. Created Quick Start Scripts
1. **start_docai.sh** - Comprehensive startup script with:
   - Environment checks
   - Port cleanup
   - Process management
   - Clear status messages

2. **stop_docai.sh** - Clean shutdown script

### 3. Running the Application

#### Method 1: Using System Python (Working)
```bash
cd /media/erl/New Volume/ai_agent/DOCUMENT AGENT/doc_ai/DocAI/docai_new_frontend/DocAI
python3 main_copy.py
```

#### Method 2: Using Quick Start Script
```bash
./start_docai.sh    # Start
./stop_docai.sh     # Stop
```

#### Method 3: Separate Servers (Original Working Method)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
python3 main_copy.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd static2.0
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### 4. Virtual Environment Setup (In Progress)
```bash
# Create new virtual environment
python3 -m venv docai_env_new

# Activate
source docai_env_new/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (in progress)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Access URLs
- **Single Server**: http://localhost:8090
- **Separate Servers**: 
  - Frontend: http://localhost:8080/indexf.html
  - Backend API: http://localhost:8090

### 6. Environment Configuration
**.env file required with:**
```
GROQ_API_KEY=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
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=a89f3c5d7e1b6042958fdae2c71b9403x8p2q5r7t9v1w4y6z8n3m5k7j9h2g4f6d8s
```

### 7. Key File Locations
- Backend: `main_copy.py`, `rag_handler.py`, `config.py`
- Frontend: `static2.0/` folder
  - `indexf.html` - Main HTML
  - `app.js` - Main JavaScript
  - `enhanced-viewer.js` - Document viewer
  - `stylenew.css` - Styles

### 8. Pending Tasks
- Complete virtual environment package installation
- Implement file upload handlers in JavaScript
- Test full integration after venv setup

### 9. Important Notes
- System Python has all packages installed and works
- Virtual environment needs full package installation (~2GB)
- The 404 handler issue was preventing static files from being served
- Single server setup now works correctly on port 8090

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /media/erl/New Volume/ai_agent/DOCUMENT AGENT/doc_ai/DocAI/docai_new_frontend/DocAI

# Option 1: Use system Python
python3 main_copy.py

# Option 2: Complete venv setup
source docai_env_new/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_copy.py

# Option 3: Use quick start
./start_docai.sh
```

## Backup Locations
1. `/backups/DocAI_CLEAN_V1_2025-06-19` - First version with LibreOffice viewer
2. `/backups/DocAI_WORKING_2025-06-21_02-02-15_FULL_INTEGRATION` - Current working version
