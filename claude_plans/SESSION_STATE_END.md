# DocAI Native - Session End State
**Date**: 2025-07-19
**Final Version**: v1.13

## Current State
From the screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ File dialog opens when clicking "Open File"
- ✅ File can be selected (ERL-Offer Letter.docx)
- ✅ Change event fires successfully
- ✅ File is read (Files: 1)
- ❌ File NOT showing in left container despite successful selection

## Debug Output Shows:
```
5:09:32 am: [handleWebOpenFile] Function called
5:09:32 am: [handleWebOpenFile] Input created
5:09:32 am: [handleWebOpenFile] About to click input
5:09:32 am: [handleWebOpenFile] Input clicked
5:09:33 am: [handleWebOpenFile] Input removed from DOM
5:09:36 am: [handleWebOpenFile] input event fired
5:09:36 am: [handleWebOpenFile] Files: 1
5:09:36 am: [handleWebOpenFile] File selected: ERL-Offer Letter.docx
5:09:36 am: [handleWebOpenFile] change event fired
5:09:36 am: [handleWebOpenFile] Files: 1
5:09:36 am: [handleWebOpenFile] File selected: ERL-Offer Letter.docx
```

## Key Issues Faced

### 1. PyWebView API Exposure
- Spent hours trying to fix PyWebView API methods not being exposed
- Tried class-based, dict-based, and minimal APIs
- PyWebView has known issues with exposing Python methods to JavaScript

### 2. File Input in Native App
- HTML file input behaves differently in PyWebView vs browser
- Initially, onchange event wasn't firing
- Fixed by adding input to DOM temporarily
- Events now fire but file still not displaying

### 3. Function Scope Issues
- Functions defined inside DOMContentLoaded weren't accessible
- Had to move handleWebOpenFile to global scope
- addFileToContainer might still have scope/timing issues

## What's Working
1. File dialog opens ✓
2. File selection works ✓
3. Events fire properly ✓
4. File is being read (based on debug output) ✓

## What's NOT Working
1. File not appearing in left container
2. Missing debug output for:
   - File read complete
   - addFileToContainer being called
   - Any errors during file processing

## Tomorrow's Tasks

### 1. Debug File Reading
The FileReader onload event doesn't seem to fire. Need to check:
- Add debug message right before `reader.readAsText(file)`
- Add debug in reader.onload
- Add debug in reader.onerror
- Check if FileReader works in PyWebView

### 2. Check addFileToContainer
- Verify if window.addFileToContainer exists when needed
- Add debug inside addFileToContainer function
- Check if filebox element exists
- Verify fileList array is being updated

### 3. Alternative Approaches
If FileReader doesn't work in PyWebView:
- Use backend file upload approach (like newer DocAI)
- Read file on Python side and pass content to JavaScript
- Use PyWebView's expose method to read files

### 4. Simplify Architecture
Current issue: Too many duplicate functions and complex scope
- Remove duplicate addFileToContainer functions
- Ensure all functions are globally accessible
- Clean up the code structure

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Add More Debug Points**:
```javascript
reader.onload = function(event) {
    showDebug('FileReader onload triggered!'); // ADD THIS
    // rest of code
};

reader.readAsText(file);
showDebug('Called readAsText on file'); // ADD THIS
```

2. **Test FileReader Separately**:
Create a simple test to verify FileReader works in PyWebView

3. **Consider Backend Approach**:
Since we have a Flask backend, consider uploading files there and fetching content

4. **Check Original Static2.0**:
Verify if the original implementation actually works in PyWebView or only in browser

## Final Notes
- User is frustrated with time spent on simple feature
- Need to focus on getting basic functionality working
- Consider simpler approaches that work reliably in PyWebView
- The debug panel (v1.12) was helpful for native app debugging
