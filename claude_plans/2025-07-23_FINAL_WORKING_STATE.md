# DocAI Native - Final Working State
**Date: July 23, 2025**

## Overview
DocAI Native is now fully functional with the ability to browse, open, and view documents from anywhere on the system. All file loading issues have been resolved.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Port Configuration
- **File**: `config.py`
- **Change**: Set `FLASK_PORT = 8090` (was 0 for random port)
- **Result**: Backend now runs on fixed port 8090, matching frontend expectations

### 2. Directory Search Paths
- **File**: `app/api/v1.py`
- **Change**: Added `CFG.DOCUMENTS_DIR.parent` to search paths
- **Result**: Files in `/home/erl/Documents/` are now listed and accessible

### 3. Filename Encoding
- **Already Working**: URL-encoded filenames (e.g., "ERL-Offer%20Letter.docx") are properly decoded
- **Display**: Shows as "ERL-Offer Letter.docx" in the UI

## Working Features

### 1. File Browsing
- Lists files from multiple locations:
  - `/home/erl/Documents/DurgaAI/`
  - `/home/erl/Documents/` (parent directory)
  - `[app_dir]/uploads/`
  - `[app_dir]/../DocAI/uploads/documents/`
- Shows decoded filenames in the left panel
- Search functionality to filter files

### 2. File Opening Methods

#### Method 1: Click from File List
- Click any file in the left panel
- File loads automatically in the viewer
- Works for files in configured directories

#### Method 2: Open File Dialog (System-wide)
- Click "Files" menu → "Open File"
- Native file picker dialog opens
- Browse and select any document file from anywhere on the system
- File loads directly using absolute path

### 3. Document Viewing
- Supports: .doc, .docx, .odt, .pdf, .txt files
- Uses LibreOffice UNO converter for document rendering
- HTML-based display in the center panel
- Edit mode available for supported formats

### 4. Native Features
- PyWebView integration for desktop experience
- Native file dialogs
- Direct file system access
- No upload required - works with files in-place

## File Flow

### From File List:
1. User clicks file in left panel
2. `handleFileClick(fileName)` is called
3. `displayDocumentFromBackend(fileName)` fetches from `/view_document/<filename>`
4. Backend searches configured directories for the file
5. Document is converted to HTML and displayed

### From File Picker:
1. User selects "Files" → "Open File"
2. `handleNativeOpenFile()` opens native file dialog
3. User selects file from anywhere on system
4. `openDocumentFromPath(filePath)` sends absolute path to `/view_document_direct`
5. Backend processes file directly from provided path
6. Document is converted to HTML and displayed

## Server Endpoints

### `/api/v1/files`
- Lists files from configured directories
- Returns decoded filenames for display
- Includes file metadata (size, modified date)

### `/view_document/<filename>`
- Loads files by name from configured directories
- Handles URL-encoded filenames
- Returns HTML-converted document content

### `/view_document_direct` (POST)
- Accepts absolute file path in request body
- Loads any file from the system
- Used by file picker for system-wide access

## Configuration

### Ports:
- Flask Backend: 8090
- UNO Bridge: Dynamic (assigned at runtime)

### Search Directories:
1. `~/Documents/DurgaAI/`
2. `~/Documents/`
3. `[app_dir]/uploads/`
4. `[app_dir]/../DocAI/uploads/documents/`

### Supported File Types:
- Microsoft Word: .doc, .docx
- OpenDocument: .odt
- PDF: .pdf
- Text: .txt

## Running the Application

```bash
# Navigate to app directory
cd /media/erl/New\ Volume/ai_agent/BROWSER\ AGENT/docai_final/DocAI_Native

# Run the application
python3 main.py

# The app will:
# 1. Start Flask server on port 8090
# 2. Start UNO bridge for LibreOffice
# 3. Open PyWebView window
# 4. Load the UI at http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

## Debug Information
- Logs: `logs/docai.log`
- Debug console visible in the app (bottom panel)
- Shows file loading progress and any errors

## Current Status
✅ File listing working
✅ File loading working
✅ System-wide file picker working
✅ Document rendering working
✅ URL-encoded filename handling working
✅ Native desktop experience working

The application is fully functional for browsing and viewing documents from both configured directories and anywhere on the file system.
