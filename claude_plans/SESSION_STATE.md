# DocAI Native - Session State & Continuation Instructions

## Current Issue Status
**Problem**: Open File functionality not working in DocAI Native application
**Last Update**: 2025-07-19
**Cache Version**: v1.8 (Dict-based API)
**Status**: TRYING DICT-BASED API APPROACH

## Issue Summary
PyWebView is not exposing the class-based API methods properly. The API object exists but has no methods accessible from JavaScript.

## Latest Solution Attempt - Dict-based API

### Problem Identified:
- v1.7 loads correctly
- PyWebView and API objects exist
- BUT no methods are visible in the API object
- This is a known PyWebView issue with class-based APIs

### New Approach (v1.8):
Created a dictionary-based API (`native_api_dict.py`) instead of class-based, as PyWebView handles simple dictionaries better.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `/native_api_dict.py`**:
   - Simple dictionary with function references
   - No class structure
   - Direct function definitions

2. **Modified `/main.py`**:
   - Now uses `api_dict` instead of `SimpleNativeAPI` class
   - Sets window reference differently

3. **Updated version to v1.8** in all frontend files

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Check Python Console
Should see:
- "Using dict-based API for better PyWebView compatibility"
- "Dict API created with methods: ['pickFile', 'pick_file', 'getAvailableMethods', 'set_window']"

### 3. Click "Open File"
The center panel should show:
- "handleOpenFile v1.8 Called! (Dict API)"
- List of actual API methods available

### 4. What to Look For
If the dict-based approach works, you should see methods listed when clicking Open File.

## Alternative Solutions to Try

### If Dict API Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Try the synchronous approach** - PyWebView might not handle async/promises well
2. **Use a global function approach** - Expose functions directly on window object
3. **Try PyWebView's built-in file dialog** - Use a different API pattern

## Debug Information Added
- Visual display shows v1.8 and "Dict API"
- Shows actual methods available in the API object
- No need for console access - everything displays in UI

## Files Changed in v1.8:
- `/native_api_dict.py` - New dict-based API
- `/main.py` - Uses dict API instead of class
- `/frontend/index.html` - Updated to v1.8

**STATUS**: Testing dict-based API approach. If methods still don't appear, we'll need to try a different PyWebView API pattern.
